# Sorting Algorithms
Authors: Christopher Waschke, Jackson Jenks, Brody Weinkauf

Within this repo there are three files each of which contain one sorting algorithm.

The algorithms are:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort.

We've also included a Shell Sort, but we had a hard time figuring how to write the comments explaining the algorithm.

We've also included a simple test class with a UI wrapper for each of sorting algorithms.

## For Extra Credit:
- All of the sorting Algorithms were implemented using generics, meaning that they can be used across data types.
- We've ported our Algorithms to C#, please see the following repo: https://github.com/WhyNot2-del/Sorting-Algorithms-CS
- We've also ported our Algorithms to Python, please see the following repo: https://github.com/snorp09/Sorting-Algorithms-Python
